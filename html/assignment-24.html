    Text Alignment in CSS
  </h1>

  <div class="text-container">
    <p class="left-align">This paragraph is left-aligned. This is the default text alignment in most browsers.</p>

    <p class="center-align">This paragraph is center-aligned. It's often used for headings or special content.</p>

    <p class="right-align">This paragraph is right-aligned. It's less common, but sometimes used for design or numbers.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="note">
    <strong>Note:</strong> <em>Justify</em> spreads text evenly to fill the entire line width, creating clean edges on both sides. <em>Center</em> simply aligns the whole text block to the middle.
