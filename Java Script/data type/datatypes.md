# Primtive data types in JavaScript

These data types are pretty simple, and are sometimes treated as the lowest level of implementation of a programming language. They are not objects, and do not have methods.

- Examples of such data types are numbers, strings, booleans, null, and undefined.

# Reference data types in JavaScript
Reference data types, unlike primitive data types, are dynamic in nature. That is, they do not have a fixed size.

Most of them are considered as objects, and therefore have methods.

- Examples of such data types include arrays, functions, collections, and all other types of objects.
